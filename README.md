## [Example Playbook](#example-playbook)

This example is taken from [`molecule/default/converge.yml`](https://github.com/buluma/ansible-role-restore/blob/master/molecule/default/converge.yml) and is tested on each push, pull request and release.

```yaml
---
- name: Converge
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: yes

  roles:
    - role: buluma.restore
```

The machine needs to be prepared. In CI this is done using [`molecule/default/prepare.yml`](https://github.com/buluma/ansible-role-restore/blob/master/molecule/default/prepare.yml):

```yaml
---
- name: Prepare
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: no
  become: yes

  roles:
    - role: buluma.bootstrap
    - role: buluma.core_dependencies
    - role: buluma.mysql
    - role: buluma.buildtools
    - role: buluma.epel
    - role: buluma.python_pip
    - role: buluma.postgres
```

Also see a [full explanation and example](https://buluma.github.io/how-to-use-these-roles.html) on how to use these roles.

## [Role Variables](#role-variables)

The default values for the variables are set in [`defaults/main.yml`](https://github.com/buluma/ansible-role-restore/blob/master/defaults/main.yml):

```yaml
---
# defaults file for restore

# What directory are the objects to be restored saved?
restore_directory: backups

# The directory of objects which need to be placed on the managed node
# temporarily.
restore_remote_directory: /tmp

# Credentials to login to the mysql database, only require when restoring mysql
# objects.
# restore_mysql_username: "my_user"
# restore_mysql_password: "my_pass"

# A list of objects to restore.
# Each list item should have:
# - name to find the object locally.
#   type, either directory or mysql.
#   destination, a directory where to unpack the object.
#
# Nota bene; the [backup role](http://galaxy.ansible.com/buluma/backup) can be used to create restorable objects. The objects created with this role include the parent directory, so the destination mentioned here ~misses~ the last part of the directory

restore_objects:
  - name: varspool
    type: directory
    destination: /var
#  - name: drupal
#    type: mysql
#    destination: drupal
```
